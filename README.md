**HW1 for CS540**

**Task**: Write a program that utilizes the shell or system function to execute various shell commands.

**Use the following list of shell commands in your program**:
- dir (list directory contents, Windows equivalent of ls)
- cd (print directory)

**This program interacts with the computers terminal using system() in C++**

I added some additional features such as:
